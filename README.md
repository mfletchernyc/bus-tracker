## active alert for the G train

No G between Bedford-Nostrand Avs, Brooklyn and Court Sq, Queens Until 8:30 PM Sunday, Aug 11
G runs between Church Av and Bedford-Nostrand Avs, the last stop.
Free B98 shuttle buses make stops between Bedford-Nostrand Avs and Court Sq.

These shuttles are barely being handled. Need to add map data for this route.

Need to handle changes like this better.

## service alert for B48

<s>B48 stops along Lorimer St between Grand St and Meeker Ave are closed.</s>

Construction at the Lorimer Street L Station is complete. Map data needs to be restored.
